# nano-rl

This repository contains minimal example implementations of RL algorithms for
LLMs. Each algorithm lives in its own directory; you'll find documentation
therein:
- [REINFORCE](src/nano_rl/reinforce)
- [GRPO](src/nano_rl/grpo)
- [DAPO](src/nano_rl/dapo)

## Development

You may find the `./lint.sh` and `./test.sh` scripts helpful.
